                    <p>1. Objective:</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>The purpose of the professional Human Potential Assessment report is to shed light on the deeper
                    drivers of your professional performance and value-creation. This unique approach to assessing
                    professionals brings the focus back to the most basic, yet most misunderstood aspect of ourselves;
                    our Human Potential.</p>
                  <p>Both modern management science and ancient wisdom traditions recognize a certain state consistent
                    among those who fully realize their Human Potential. These people tend to lead meaningful and
                    fulfilling lives, create significant impact in the work that they do, and have the ability to do all
                    of this while remaining centered, irrespective of the circumstances they encounter. By measuring the
                    intangible nature of Human Potential, we are able to unlock breakthrough insights and open up new
                    conversations. In the process, we create the conditions for a more meaningful and fulfilling work
                    experience, which will ultimately lead to sustainable professional performance.</p>

                    <p>2. How to interpret the report:</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Although we structure the data clearly and report it back in a way that is easy to
                    understand and interpret, we deliberately refrain from offering fully articulated
                    conclusions and recommendations. Instead, we offer you objective findings, including
                    numbers. Although the numbers are an important part of the solution, this is not where
                    the focus should be when you study this report. We invite you to use the scores simply
                    as an entry point for meaningful self-examination and to ask exploratory questions</p>
                  <p>We consistently notice that the most profound discoveries and lasting commitments to
                    next steps happen when you can find your own story in the data, and you arrive at the
                    conclusions that make most sense for you at this moment in time. </p>
                  <div class="inner_title">
                    <p>3. How to interpret the color codes:</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>Throughout the report we will be using four different colors (purple, green, yellow and
                    red) to represent the scores. It is important that these codes are NOT interpreted as
                    "good" or "bad". Instead, look at them as "EXPRESSED" for green and purple, and
                    "UNEXPRESSED" for yellow and red. For example, a yellow or red score does NOT
                    mean that you do not have the inherent ability to thrive in that area. It simply indicates
                    that at the current point in time it is not fully EXPRESSED. The question then becomes,
                    'How do you access more fully the dormant potential in this area?' Similarly, a purple
                    score does not mean that there is no further room to grow. It just tells you that at this
                    current point of time, and with your current level of awareness, you are expressing your
                    full potential in that area of life. This can obviously change when your awareness shifts to
                    a new level.</p>

                    <p>4. Structure of the report:</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>To make it as easy as possible for you to assimilate the findings, we have structured the
                    report according to the fundamental belief that underpins all of this work; namely, 'PEAK
                    EXPERIENCE LEADS TO PEAK PERFORMANCE'. In other words, when you express
                    your unique Human Potential (gifts, talents, aspirations) and bring your full self to work,
                    you are able to access greater levels of inspiration and hence deliver breakthrough
                    results. Therefore, the first part of this report (section 3) focuses on the top of the iceberg
                    (i.e.: your professional PERFORMANCE) along the following key organizational
                    priorities: Inventiveness, Customer Orientation, Trustworthiness, Employee Engagement,
                    Self-Leadership and Getting Things Done (above water in figure 1). In section 4 of the
                    report, our attention shifts to measuring and analyzing your human EXPERIENCE
                    (middle of figure 1: 4 BEING States). Finally, in section 5 of this report, we examine how
                    you are doing on the key (inner)leadership attitudes/behaviors that you need to adopt in
                    order to further enhance your human experience, and as a result, create the conditions
                    for a new wave of value-creation to emerge (Bottom of figure 1: 8 BEING Attitudes).</p>

                  <p>In the following report, you will be provided with many more detailed findings that will
                    help you in these development efforts. Some of them will resonate strongly and trigger a
                    desire to act, while others may not feel as relevant at first glance. We invite you not to
                    ignore these tensions as our experience shows that the most powerful insights are often
                    hidden beneath the contradictions that you may perceive in the data. We strongly
                    recommend that you work with a trained Human Potential coach to fully understand the
                    findings and discover ways in which they can be integrated into your life.

                        Aware. Within each State are a number of Dimensions to help you understand the levels of
                        Human Potential realization and pinpoint the areas that will have the greatest impact on

                    yet. By looking at the top and bottom 3 dimensions from this perspective, it is possible to start
                    prioritizing future areas of development that will further unlock your human potential and create
                    a compelling work experience.

                    important drivers of your life. You are concerned about your - and your dear ones - future. Whether
                    at
                    work or in your family, you are motivated by (self) preservation. Saving and having enough reserves
                    for
                    a "rainy day" is important to you. Where others do not see a reason to worry, you will feel inclined
                    to
                    worry. There is an opportunity to work through some of these fears and in doing so build more trust

                    yourself and the people around you.</p>
                  <p *ngIf="personal_index >= 2.4 && personal_index < 2.8">It is important for you to belong, whether it
                    is
                    at work or at home or in groups you participate in. You are sensitive to the type of work atmosphere
                    you
                    operate in. You make an effort to be an important part of groups, and value others recognizing your
                    effort and contribution to groups. You go out of your way to give to teams and groups so that they
                    acknowledge you. There is an opportunity for you to define your identity or fulfillment based on
                    your

                    and
                    underlying motives. You typically make decisions with a lot of forethought and plenty of
                    supporting data. In that process, you might tend to play it safe in order to avoid
                    making
                    "mistakes". In doing so, you might forgo the opportunity for passion, creativity and
                    breakthroughs to emerge. Growing to the next level of maturity (PURPOSE) will require
                    more

                    of
                    people around you. In addition to the rational processes, it might help to access and

                    to a
                    higher purpose. You now value meaning more than the security that your relationships, work, living

                    best
                    out of people. You see possibilities in everything happening around you. You have a high level of

                    recognize you as a wisdom-carrier.</p>

                    see

                    Potential Realization, and what you need to focus on in the future in order to further grow into
                    your full potential. </p>
                  <p>The next step for you is to process and integrate the insights coming out of this report so they
                    can be transformed into actionable next steps, fully owned by you. You are invited to look
                    deeply into your current beliefs and assumptions that drive you as a professional today and
                    make very deliberate choices on who you want to BE going forward. </p>
                  <p>Though this report is fairly self-explanatory, we recommend you use the services of a coach,
                    consultant or mentor who is trained in Human Potential development. This will ensure that the
                    insights from this report are fully integrated and transformed into an impactful personal action
                    plan. </p>
                  <p>In this follow-up, we invite you to visualize your new intentions in full details and start shaping
                    them. That is the secret to creating a targeted development plan that might include training and
                    coaching programs that turn your new inner states into a reality. You could develop new
                    language and rituals, practice new leadership habits, and gradually make a new
