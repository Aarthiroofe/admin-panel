                        &quot;bad&quot;. A person with a
                        high Human Potential score is not better than someone with a low score. Rather, you should
                        be looking at lower scores as opportunity areas that can bring out even more of your
                        inherent capabilities. The model will show you how to do this. It will reveal the key leverage
                        points to focus on and key questions to explore in your personal development work.

                        We believe every person is gifted with abundant potential. However, the extent to which this
                        is realized in one’s day-to-day life can vary significantly. Some people are in tune with their
                        greatest potential and have found ways to integrate it into their lives. This not only brings
                        them enormous fulfillment, but it is also the most effective way to have an impact and
                        contribute to the world in a meaningful way. Other people are aware of their unique gifts but
                        haven’t yet found ways to fully realize this potential. Unfortunately, many of us go through
                        life not really knowing the extent of our potential and therefore much of it remains
                        untapped.

                    believe that when your BEING is ignited and you access your most passionate self, all of life
                    becomes a joyful and incredibly rewarding experience. We believe that you will realize your Full

                  <p class="mb-5">The Human Potential Assessment Tool is the beginning of a 3-step process. It starts by
                    putting
                    the necessary facts &amp; data on the table to enable the right conversations and identify the key
                    levers to further unlock your Human Potential.</p>
                  <p class="mb-5">The in the next phase we recommend working with a coach to integrate these findings
                    and
                    make them your own. It&#39;s this discovery process that will trigger deep commitment and lasting
                    engagement. At the end of this critical phase the next steps and personal development roadmap
                    will become clear. Finally, together with a coach, you may work together to unleash and liberate
                    your untapped potential.</p>

                  <p>In this model, maximizing Human Potential is directly dependent on triggering four key States
                    within you; BEING Aware, BEING Inspired, BEING Abundant and BEING in Service. (see Appendix
                    1 for the definition of each of these States).</p>
                  <p>Within each State are a number of Dimensions to help you understand the levers of Human

                    origin
                    in the Indian spiritual traditions. These five layers measure your level of consciousness (or
                    maturity) at this point in time and indicate your next stage of growth or maturity. Below are
                    the descriptions of the five levels</p>

                      <p>Security, paying your bills, your daily needs taken care of, etc. are important drivers
                        of
                        your life. You are concerned about your, and your dear ones, future. Whether at work
                        or in
                        your family, you are motivated by (self) preservation. Saving and having enough reserves
                        for
                        a "rainy day" is important to you. Where others do not see a reason to worry, you will
                        feel
                        inclined to worry. There is an opportunity to work through some of these fears, and in
                        doing so, build more trust in yourself and the people around you.</p>

                        make an

                        contribution to groups. You go out of your way to give to teams and groups so that they

                        making

                        more
                        compassionate and visionary leadership that is committed to realizing the full potential
